### Week - 1 Assignment:
I searched dataset which consists of soil qualities and weather conditions for cultivating a crop.
- Data selection and Data Preprocessing
- Choosed to train Random Forest model for prediction with multiple inputs
- Initial accuracy - 98%

### Future plans:
- Increasing dataset size and training the model for precision, Optimisation in case of avoiding Overfitting.
- Planning to train another Image processing model for predicting type of sand in the input image.
- NLP integration for recemmending suitable crops on the predicted soil and the farming conditions.
