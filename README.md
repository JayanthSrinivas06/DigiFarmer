### Week - 2 Assignment:
Classifying and gathering the soil images of different types and started training the model.
- Image preprocessing
- Training on ResNet assuming as good image processing model(Could change if we got better model than this in future)
- Initial accuracy - 96.57%

### Future plans:
- Increasing dataset size and training the model for precision, Optimisation in case of avoiding Overfitting.
- Search and train another image processing model for better predictions.
- If possible, using a framework like flask or FastAPI for deployment.
